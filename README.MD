# Plate Completer

A New Zealand License Plate Auto Completer

# What would I use this for?
Say you somehow have a photo of a NZ license plate, however the photo didn't capture clearly the entire sequence but you still have a few characters.
 
 As example could be this photo taken from Google Maps...

This plate has the first part visible 'CTN9' but the remainder is unclear, it looks like a 4 but the last character is completely blurred.

Therefore we can use the plate completer to find out what this plate actually is. By giving it a few known parameters, such as the brand, color, and type of car (eg: TOYOTA, BLUE, STATION-WAGON), it will search for the possible combinations with those requirements.

# Todo
- Get parameters from user about vehicle (eg: color, transmission, etc)
- Find and use API
